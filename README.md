# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to help the foundation predict where to make investments. We helped Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing 
1. The variable that is considered our target for our model is the IS_SUCCESSFUL variable since our purpose is to predict which applicants would be successful in the funding process.
2. The variables that are considered our features for our model are the APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, and ASK_AMT.
3. The variables that are not considered targets or features are the EIN and NAME variable so they are removed from the input data. 

## Summary
The target model performance was 75% accuracy which our deep learning model did not reach.
